# Agent Notes

## Project Status
The Godot 4 project skeleton now lives in `/godot`, with starter scenes, scripts, and data-driven items/recipes. Keep this file updated whenever the repo structure or workflows change.

## Conventions
- Use `godot/scripts/` for gameplay logic and keep systems modular.
- Prefer JSON in `godot/data/` for item/recipe definitions.
- Update `README.md` after meaningful gameplay progress.

## Testing
- `pytest` validates JSON data in `godot/data/`.
